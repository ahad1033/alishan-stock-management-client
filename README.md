# Alishan — Stock Management Web Application (Frontend)

Alishan is a modern, role-based stock management web application built with **React 19**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. This project serves as the frontend of a MERN stack solution, designed to streamline inventory control, invoice processing, expense tracking, and financial analytics in a structured and scalable way.

> ⚠️ This is the **frontend** codebase only. The backend (Express + MongoDB) is maintained separately.
